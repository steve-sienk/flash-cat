# flash-cat
A flashlight that can copy a color. Like a copycat, but a flashlight -- a flash-cat.

Programmed with an Arduino.

These are the parts I used, though it would be easy to change out the board and LED ring:
- [ItsyBitsy M0](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-itsy-bitsy-m0)
- [Flora Color Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1356)
- An old flashlight and some batteries.
- [NeoPixel Jewel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2226)

Pictures and things coming soon. 


## Setup

### Software

#### Quick Overview
Download `flashcat.io` and load it into your Arduino IDE.
Use the Arduino's Library Manager to install these Adafruit libraries as necessary:

- Adafruit_DotStar

From Arduino's BoardManager, select `Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0` in the list of `Adafruit SAMD Boards`.
Select the appropriate programming port, and upload.
